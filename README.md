# Eco-Driving

Developed at: Institute of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich
Contact: Olaf Teichert, teichert@ftm.mw.tum.de

Scope: The tool uses dynamic programming to calculate the optimal speed profile for a bus, taking speed limits, turns, stops, traffic lights and a leading vehicle into account

A publication describing the tool has been presented at the ITSC2020 in Rhodos and can be accessed at: doi.org/10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294517

## Installation requirements
The code was developed and tested on Matlab 2020a. All required files to reproduce the results from the paper are included in the repository. No additional matlab packages are required. 

## Running the Model/Code
The results are generated by executing the "Main.py" file. The execution time on a 16GB RAM, 1.8GHz machine is approximately 2 minutes.
